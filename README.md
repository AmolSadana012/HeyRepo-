## Self Introduction:

I am Amol Sadana, a B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering student with strong interests in **Software Development**, **Data Science**, and **Machine Learning**. I enjoy building practical, real-world projects that demonstrate problem-solving ability, clean coding practices, and continuous learning.

Over time, I have worked on projects spanning full-stack web development, system simulations, and machine learning models, which has helped me develop a well-rounded technical foundation. I am currently deepening my understanding of **Data Structures & Algorithms**, and **Data Science projects**, while actively designing, improving, and maintaining projects on GitHub.

I am motivated to work in environments that emphasize strong engineering practices, real-world problem solving, and continuous learning, and I enjoy collaborating on projects that create meaningful impact.
